import logging

With the logging module imported, you can use something called a “logger” to log messages.

By default, there are 5 standard levels indicating the severity of events.
Each has a corresponding method that can be used to log events at that level of severity: DEBUG INFO WARNING ERROR CRITICAL

The logging config file allows setting setting the logging format (i.e. timestamped) and handlers to redirect logs to different files.

Example:
import logging

logging.debug('This is a debug message')
logging.info('This is an info message')
logging.warning('This is a warning message')
logging.error('This is an error message')
logging.critical('This is a critical message')

#=> (debug & info are not shown by default)
#WARNING:root:This is a warning message
#ERROR:root:This is an error message
#CRITICAL:root:This is a critical message

Example:
logging.basicConfig(format='%(asctime)s - %(message)s', level=logging.INFO)
logging.info('Admin logged in')
=> 2018-07-11 20:12:06,288 - Admin logged in
